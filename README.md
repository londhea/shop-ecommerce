# shop-ecommerce

I have created E-commerce web application using Java and Spring boot. In this project, there are two roles User and Admin. Admin can manage products and Categories. whereas, user can add products to the cart and checkout. 

Here, I have used Java, Spring boot, Data JPA, Spring OAuth Security and MySql for database.
